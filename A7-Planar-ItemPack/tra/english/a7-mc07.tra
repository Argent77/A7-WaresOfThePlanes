@11 = ~This mace looks much like any other mace - a spiked ball atop a wooden shaft, leather handgrip with a thong to prevent losing it in the heat of battle. Where it differs is in the Eye etched in acid on the head of the weapon, a stylized sigil of the god Horus.

This weapon is The Justifier, a mace created in the city of Heliopolis on the plane of Arcadia, designed to aid the followers of law and good. It can heal its owner, if asked, and harbors a special hatred for the forces of chaos and evil.
