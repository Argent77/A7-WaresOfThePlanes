@11 = ~Research reveals that this is a formidable weapon indeed. Far superior to a normal hammer, this war hammer (also called "The Hammer of Comminution") delivers a devastating strike that not only inflicts crushing damage, but also fractures any surface it contacts, whether bone, metal, or wood, inflicting extra damageâ€¦ and if the victim survives, it also "softens" him up for the next attack. 

The Hammer of Comminution was used extensively by Enote, a Doomguard priest, in 14 E.U. A philosopher who was prone to violent mood swings while debating theology, he was known to espouse the virtues of the hammer as a means of furthering the decay of dead matter. Whether or not what he struck with the hammer was dead or alive before the blow is open to debate.
