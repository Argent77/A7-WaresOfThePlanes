@11 = ~These earrings have been made from the hardened shell of a segmented, larva-like creature. Their shell has been treated with some sort of glazed finish that makes it look disturbingly alive. The wire that hooks to the ear looks like it is part of the larva itself, perhaps its stinger or antenna.

To activate the earrings' power, the wearer must prick his thumb with the stinger, allowing it to bond with its new owner. When "awakened," these earrings help protect the wearer from attacks, giving the wearer's skin the same strength and durability of the larva's shell.
