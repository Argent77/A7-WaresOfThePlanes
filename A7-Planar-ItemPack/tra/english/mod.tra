@3101 = ~A gnomish contraption

Ebb Creakknees told me news about his latest acquisitions when I met him in Amkethran. It is apparently an exotic weapon of some kind that he procured from a gnome wizard. Unfortunately it is broken. Maybe there is something I can help him with?~

@3102 = ~A gnomish contraption

According to the repair instructions Ebb received from the gnome the broken parts of the weapon can be replaced. Several items are needed for this, however: a beljuril gem and scrolls of Protection from Magic Energy and Disintegrate. I'm beginning to wonder how lethal that weapon turns out to be.~

@3103 = ~A gnomish contraption

I delivered the items needed to repair the gnomish weapon. Ebb left to see the gnome again which should take about a day.~

@3150 = ~A gnomish contraption

Ebb Creakknees was true to his word and returned with the repaired artifact. He placed it into his store where I can buy it if I want to.~

@3151 = ~A gnomish contraption

It looks as if Ebb Creakknees has left permanently, as events in Amkethran have come thick and fast. I should have visited him sooner, before all hell broke loose.~
