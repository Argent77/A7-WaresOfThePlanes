@11 = ~From a Hero of ancient times during the Year of Gii 'on, AC195, this exquisite ring is smartly carved, with spiked edges. The ring is made of a metal that is unidentifiable, with a center stone that is ice cold to the touch. It emanates a powerful aura that protects its bearer from bodily harm and makes them more sensitive to the effects of the Weave - which can be a blessing or a curse.
