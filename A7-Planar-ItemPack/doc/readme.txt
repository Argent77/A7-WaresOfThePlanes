Overview
~~~~~~~~

This mod introduces a great number of weapons and accessories from Planescape: Torment in the
Baldur's Gate series. The items can be purchased from a travelling merchant who is available
throughout the whole game.

Several items have been slightly altered to fit better into the BG series since items from the
Planescape universe are generally more powerful than their Forgotten Realms counterparts.

The mod is available for BG:EE, Siege of Dragonspear, BG2:EE and EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy).


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive
into your game directory and run either "setup-A7-Planar-ItemPack.exe" (Windows) or
"setup-A7-Planar-ItemPack.command" (macOS). Follow the instructions and you are ready to start.

To uninstall, run "setup-A7-Planar-ItemPack.exe" (Windows) or "setup-A7-Planar-ItemPack.command"
(macOS) again and follow the prompts.

Note for Siege of Dragonspear (SoD):
GOG and Steam both install the "Siege of Dragonspear" expansion in a way that is not moddable 
out-of-the-box. You must first install the mod "DLC Merger" on your SoD installation before this
or any other WeiDU-based mods can be installed.
DLC Merger can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest


Installation Order & Mod Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This mod can be installed anywhere in the mod installation order.

There are no compatibility issues known with other mods. A small number of items may overlap with
items from Angel's Made in Heaven - Item Pack. But they won't interfere with each other except by
have the same item names.


Components
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Planar Item Pack (for BG:EE, SoD, BG2:EE and EET)

This is the main component. It installs a great number of items from Planescape: Torment which
includes weapons, accessories, utility items, and more. They can be purchased from a unique
travelling merchant who can be encountered throughout the whole Baldur's Gate series.

As the items vary greatly in strength, they are only gradually made available as the main story
of the game progresses.


2. Identify all items (not recommended; requires main component)

This tweak identifies all items introduced by the main component.

Notes:
It is generally not recommended to install this tweak since it diminishes the mod experience.
Install it only if you want to complement Tweaks Anthology's subcomponent "Identify All Items"
or similar tweaks.
