1. Daggers
~~~~~~~~~~

1.1. Backbiter +1 (available: BG1 chapter 5 or later)
Crafted specifically with the adept thief in mind, this magical blade masks the approach of the 
wielder by muffling any sounds he or she might make in passing, thus improving his or her chances 
of approaching a target by stealth.

1.5. Entropic Blade +3 (available: BG2:ToB chapter 8 or later)
The surface of this small dagger twists and bends as you watch, as if struggling to break free from 
its shape.

It looks to be made of iron, silver, and any of a number of different metals. Sometimes they blend 
together, other times, they submerge into the core of the blade, only to resurface again minutes 
later.

"Enlightenment", along with "Ascension" and "Reason", are weapons called the "Triad of Tests" by 
the Believers of the Source in Sigil. This dagger is slim, perfectly balanced, and light as a 
feather. The symbol of the Godsmen is engraved along the blade, and the entire weapon seems to 
shiver as if in anticipation.

1.7. Fiend's Blood Dagger (available: BG1 chapter 1 or later)
Years of being embedded in the flesh of a fiend have imbued this once ordinary dagger with 
qualities best left with their kind. Blood of the fiend has infused itself with the dagger causing 
it to feel slightly warm to the touch.

When in combat the user of this dagger can hear a constant chittering in the back of his mind 
causing him to lose all self-control making him unstoppable in combat, but vulnerable to spells.

The history of this dagger is for the most part unknown. More than likely some fool perished while 
fighting the fiend, losing his dagger as well as his life. For now the name is but a description, 
it has yet to earn a proper title.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Save vs. spells: -4
– Causes the wielder to go berserk in combat
– May only be removed with a Remove Curse spell

Combat abilities:
– Hit target must save vs. Death at +2 or suffer 3 points of poison damage per round for

Proficiency Type: Dagger
Type: One-handed
Requires:
 3 Strength

1.8. Chaos Feather +1 (available: SoD chapter 8 or later)
This feather is ash-gray, fading to black around the edges. It is much larger than a bird feather, 
and it creates an unpleasant tingling sensation when held for more than a minute.

Examination of the feather reveals that is the feather from a Vrock, one of the many races of 
tanar'ri that fill the Abyss. The Vrock resemble huge vultures, and they are often used as scouts 
for the tanar'ri forces in the Blood War.

This particular feather is believed to have been taken from a Vrock shaman, who is reported to have 
died by simply disbelieving himself. Possessed of a certain mental imbalance and with an odious 
habit of devouring his followers to gain strength, this crazy Vrock was rumored to be capable of 
causing others of his flock to behave erratically - much more so than for a normal tanar'ri. 
He convinced many of his flock to tear off their wings and take up burrowing in the ground. Other 
times, he preached the virtues of honesty as being more evil and destructive than any lie. When he 
disintegrated, only the feather was left behind as testament to his fevered existence. Some of the 
shaman's residue is believed to reside in this "Chaos Feather."

The Chaos Feather, when used in combat as a dagger, inflicts a minor amount of damage (about the 
same as a conventional dagger) and has the power to confuse any target it strikes. Creatures struck 
by the feather may be stunned, run away, or attack their allies.

Most tanar'ri consider the feather to be a sacred object. Vrocks will kill anyone possessing it in 
order to retrieve it.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
– Hit target must save vs. Spell or are either stunned, confused, or flee in terror
– Item can only be used a number of times before it breaks

1.9. Silver Fork (available: BG1 chapter 1 or later)
This is a silver dining fork. Its tines are especially sharp. Upon further consideration, it might 
be able to be used as a dagger, though it most likely wouldn't do any more damage than a 
conventional dagger. It might prove useful against creatures damaged only by weapons of silver or 
cold iron.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
– Bonuses to hit and damage based on strength do not apply to this weapon

1.10. Green Steel Dagger +1 (available: BG1 chapter 1 or later)
This slim dagger has been forged out of the famed Baatorian green steel. Found only in the 
wastelands of Avernus, this peculiar green ore can be tempered into metal much lighter than normal 
steel. In addition, green steel weapons tend to retain their remarkably fine edges and are capable 
of dealing out more damage than their standard counterparts.

STATISTICS:

THAC0: +1
Damage: 1d4+1 (piercing)
Speed Factor: 1

1.11. Kaarlac's Knife (available: BG1 chapter 5 or later)
The final achievement of one Kaarlac Cragenmoor, this enchanted knife is a boon to those who 
practice the mystic arts. Kaarlac, ever one to aspire to greatness, sought to create a magic item 
that could retain an imprint of a portion of his memory - particularly the short term memory that 
contained his considerable spell repertoire. He theorized that, if successful, he could effectively 
double the amount of spell knowledge he could retain at any given time.

Unfortunately, the enchantment was beyond his capability and in the midst of his fervent casting, 
Kaarlac went mad and plunged the knife into his own chest. His sacrifice, however, was not 
completely in vain, for the knife possesses enough of the intended enchantment to bestow upon its 
wielder the ability to memorize several additional first level spells.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Can memorize three extra 1st-level wizard spells

Damage: 1d4 (piercing)
Speed Factor: 2
Proficiency Type: Dagger
Type: One-handed
Requires:
 3 Strength

Weight: 1

1.12. Porphatys Dagger +3 (available: BG2:ToB chapter 8 or later)
The acids of Porphatys, the fifth layer of Carceri, are dangerous to more than a body's physical 
form - they tear at his mind and soul, eating away at his reason. Weapons forged in this heart of 
betrayal do the same thing to their owners, but too many believe that the acidic powers of a weapon 
created in Porphatys are worth the risk.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Causes the wielder to go berserk
– May only be removed with a Remove Curse spell

THAC0: +3
Damage: 1d4+3, +1d6 acid damage

1.13. High Quality Stiletto (available: BG1 chapter 1 or later)

STATISTICS:

THAC0: +1

Speed Factor: 1
Proficiency Type: Dagger
Type: One-handed
Requires:
 3 Strength

1.14. Runeblade (available: BG2:SoA chapter 6 or later)
Created by a legendary guild of battle mages known as "the Scarlet Seers," these enchanted blades 
were specifically designed as a defensive countermeasure against opposing spellcasters. The tiny 
runes etched into the blade are powerful wards that offer the wielder increased resistance against 
all types of magic. Unfortunately, with its emphasis on magical defense, the weapon's awkward 
design makes it virtually ineffective in physical combat.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Magic Resistance: +25%
– Save vs. Spell: +2

THAC0: -4
Damage: 1d4 (piercing)
Speed Factor: 3
Proficiency Type: Dagger
Type: One-handed
Requires:
 3 Strength

Weight: 1

1.15. Last Resort +6 (available: SoD chapter 8 or later)
This small dagger looks fragile, but a series of jagged teeth line the edge of the blade. The hilt 
itself is covered with dried blood, most likely the blood of the users who held the weapon and were 
unable to release their grip.

Research indicates that this cursed dagger has had many names, the most prominent of which was 
"Last Resort." When equipped, the user cannot release the grip until death, or until the curse is 
lifted by spell or divine intervention. Although the dagger is slower than most two-handed weapons 
and the damage it inflicts is comparable to a scratch, it is rumored to be able to hurt almost any 
creature it strikes, no matter what the creature's plane of origin or its defenses. One adventurer 
who had freed herself from its curse actually chose to travel with it, figuring that in any 
instance where she *had* to use it couldn't be worsened by having it in her possession.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– May only be removed with a Remove Curse spell

Combat abilities:
– Bonus to damage based on strength do not apply to this weapon

THAC0: +6
Damage: 1d2 (slashing)
Speed Factor: 10
Proficiency Type: Dagger
Type: One-handed

Weight: 1

1.16. Mad Splinter +1 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 2 or later)
This is a dagger-shaped fragment of stone taken from the statue of the Etherserian sorcerer 
Gangroighydon. It bears a powerful enchantment - each time someone is stabbed by the splinter, 
they have a chance of being Cursed. It is most likely that the fell curse trapped upon 
Gangroighydon's lips has soaked into the very stone of his petrified form, and "poisons" those 
the splinter stabs with his malicious magic.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
– Hit target must save vs. Death or suffers 1 point of poison damage per second until death or 
  getting cured
– Item can only be used a number of times before it breaks

THAC0: +1

1.17. Widowmaker +2 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 2 or later)
Tempered with the lethal venom of the dreaded hook spider, the magical properties of this blade, 
known simply as "Widowmaker," are much sought after by practicing assassins throughout the planes. 
The poison that has been magically and permanently infused into the dagger immediately infects 
those cut by it. Additionally, the wielder of "Widowmaker" immediately develops an improved 
resistance to poison simply from holding the blade.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Poison Resistance: +25%

Combat abilities:
– Hit target must save vs. Death or suffer 1 point of poison damage every 3 seconds for two rounds

2. Battle Axes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2.1. Ascension +2 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 2 or later)
"Ascension" is one of the finest weapons created at the Great Foundry, the home of the Believers of 
the Source in Sigil. It is one of three weapons called the "Triad of Tests," including the hammer 
"Reason" and the dagger "Enlightenment." The symbol of the faction is engraved on the axe head, and 
the edges of the blades are so sharp they could split a hair lengthwise.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Armor Class: +1
– Charisma: +1

THAC0: +2
Damage: 1d8+2 (slashing)
Speed Factor: 4
Proficiency Type: Axe
Type: One-handed
Requires:
 10 Strength

Weight: 4

2.2. Enchanted Battle Axe +1 (available: BG1 chapter 1 or later)
Closer examination of the weapon reveals a strange symbol, very faint, on the surface of the axe 
head. Tracing it with your finger, there is a sudden charge, and the axe head changes before your 
eyes into a silvery-looking metal.

The edge is incredibly sharp, so much so it looks like it could hack through stone if necessary. 
The symbol you traced on the weapon is now glowing brilliantly, and if anything, the axe has become 
even lighter than before.

STATISTICS:

THAC0: +1
Damage: 1d8+1 (slashing)
Speed Factor: 6
Proficiency Type: Axe
Type: One-handed
Requires:
 10 Strength

Weight: 4

2.3. Battle Axe of Quality (available: BG1 chapter 1 or later)
Intricate runes are etched on the shaft and the blades of this axe. The edges of the axe are 
razor-sharp; it looks like it would be possible to shave with it, though that's not something 
that you would try until you had consumed several tankards of ale. The handle itself is made of 
ironwood, and leather is wrapped tightly around the handle to help secure the user's grip.

STATISTICS:

THAC0: +1
Damage: 1d8+1 (slashing)
Speed Factor: 7
Proficiency Type: Axe
Type: One-handed
Requires:
 10 Strength

Weight: 8

2.4. Blindsider +1 (available: SoD chapter 8 or later)
This magnificent axe, known as "Blindsider," is truly one of a kind. It is rumored that it was the 
creation of one Akyzum Yar, chief metallurgist of an ancient empire on the Prime Material Plane. 
The Emperor whom Yar served, a vain and wicked man, commissioned the creation of "a weapon of 
unsurpassed beauty." After years of toiling, Yar succeeded and presented the Emperor with 
"Blindsider," whereupon he was promptly put to death so that his work could never be reproduced. 

The various ores and enchantments employed in the forging of this weapon yielded a new type of 
metal that is lightweight, durable, and highly reflective. The axe earned its name from its 
tendency to reflect light into the eyes of its opponent, temporarily blinding the target so that 
its wielder can easily cut him down. Additionally, its wielder is granted immunity to blinding 
attacks as a magical byproduct of its reflective nature.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Armor class: +2
– Wearer is immune to Blindness

Combat abilities:
– Hit target must save vs. Death or is blinded for one round

THAC0: +1
Damage: 1d8+1 (slashing)

Type: One-handed
Requires:
 10 Strength

Weight: 4

2.5. Butcherer of Innocents +2 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 3 or later)
This giant, axe-like cleaver earned its nickname while in the hands of Oswell Breck, a butcher who 
once serviced the Clerk's Ward of Sigil. The rumor goes that one day this affable and 
well-respected citizen suddenly went on a murderous and bloody rampage that lasted ten days and ten 
nights. Cleaver in hand, Oswell stalked the streets of the ward, brutally hacking down every man, 
woman, and child unlucky enough to cross his path until the Lady of Pain herself intervened. It is 
rumored that he suffered from a strange disease that slowly caused his body to waste away, and it 
was this disease that eroded his sanity and prompted the murder spree.

The origin of this instrument of carnage is shrouded in mystery. However, the various wizards and 
scholars who examined the discarded weapon after Oswell's mazing have catalogued the nature of its 
enchantment. The cleaver seems to feed upon its victims, sucking the very life force from them and 
bestowing a portion of it upon its wielder.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
– Transfers 2 Hit Points from target to wielder

THAC0: +2
Damage: 1d8+2 (slashing)
Speed Factor: 5
Proficiency Type: Axe
Type: One-handed
Requires:
 10 Strength

Weight: 4

2.6. Heartgrinder +3 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 2 or later)
A single teardrop of the wielder's blood, applied at the border where the axe meets the handle, is 
sufficient to awaken "Heartgrinder." Once applied, the drop of blood freckles across the blade and 
handle, giving it a dull red radiance. The glow from Heartgrinder pulses, matching the heartbeat of 
its wielder.

No matter what the target, Heartgrinder is a powerful weapon, capable of tearing through nearly 
any defenses. Against targets with blood running in their veins (whether their own or another's - 
vampires beware), Heartgrinder inflicts additional damage, as every stroke also smashes the 
target's heart, no matter what location the axe struck.

STATISTICS:

THAC0: +3

Damage type: Slashing
Speed Factor: 4
Proficiency Type: Axe

Weight: 4

2.7. Hatred's Gift +1 (available: SoD chapter 8 or later)
It is not exactly clear in the annals of known planar history when "Hatred's Gift" was created, but 
by the bloody trail it has left across the planes seems to have finally reached you. 

The axe exists to inspire hatred in one's enemies and fill its wielder with a berserker rage. When 
entering combat, the skulls along the shaft come alive, chittering their teeth, and the teeth 
(remnants of fiendish victims absorbed into the axe blade) extend outwards, biting and tearing into 
opponents with each strike. 

Once equipped, "Hatred's Gift" cannot be dropped unless its curse is removed.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Causes the wielder to go berserk
– May only be removed with a Remove Curse spell

THAC0: +1
Damage: 2d8+1 (slashing)

2.8. Axe of the Jester +3 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 6 or later)
The person who created this axe must have been mad or a genius. Only the most skilled of smiths 
could have forged a weapon using Chaos Matter, the most unstable and unpredictable element in all 
the planes.

Stories of this particular axe have been told and retold across the planes. Heroic deeds of men 
defeating creatures of immense power simply by touching the axe to the creature… and of these same 
men dying horrible deaths while doing simple everyday tasks.

Zaknar the Simple - Defeated a devourer with a single swipe of this axe. Crushed to death by a 
falling boulder in the vast plains of Tabor.

Garkon the Righteous - Struck by a mysterious discharge of energy while fighting a cranium rat.

Kannas - Tradesman by profession. Buried alive as the stone wall the axe was mounted on collapsed 
on him.

Kvry Matterson - A child of only nine seasons, was not only able to ward off a group of marauding 
fire bats, he even managed to kill 2 of them!

The list of tragedies and deeds goes on and on.

2.9. Final Judgment +3 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 6 or later)
This archaic double-bladed battle-axe is reminiscent of an executioner's axe; the axe head has been 
forged into the symbol of the Mercykiller Faction (a red dragon with its wings outspread… the 
outstretched wings have been shaped into the blades of the axe.) The axe itself is huge; it would 
require tremendous strength to use effectively.

This axe carries part of Vhailor's essence within it. As a result, it is utterly devoted to justice 
and will not allow the user to rest while "judgments" are left to be delivered. The considerable 
damage it causes to an opponent is doubled if the axe strikes a guilty or chaotic creature. 
Furthermore, the axe itself lends some of its strength to the wielder, giving them added protection 
from attacks.

The origin of this axe is unknown. If you were to hazard a guess, the axe gained its powers simply 
from Vhailor's belief.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Armor Class: +1

Requires:
 16 Strength

Weight: 12

2.10. Edge of Oblivion +2 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 2 or later)
When its powers are awakened and its name known, "Edge of Oblivion" becomes entirely black… where 
once just the edges were ebony, now the blackness has spread across the entire blade. The chill the 
blade radiates has increased ten-fold, so much so that it is painful to hold it for too long.

"Edge of Oblivion" does disintegration damage every time it strikes an opponent… for every wound it 
causes, it also disintegrates the flesh around the target area, simultaneously cauterizing the 
wound as it strikes.

There is some speculation that a Sphere of Annihilation has somehow been encaged within the axe 
itself, but again this is only speculation. Given that the planes are infinite, anything is 
possible.

3. Bolts
~~~~~~~~

3.1. Bolts of Acheron +1 (available: BG1 chapter 5 or later)
These enchanted bolts have been fashioned from one of the great cubes of Acheron. According to many 
planar scholars, Acheron is a plane in perpetual war with itself, where huge cubes the size of 
continents float through the ether and smash against each other. On the surface of these cubes, 
legions of soldiers wage war on each other, swarming from cube to cube and attacking whoever else 
they can find. The plane is filled with the ringing of steel and the great thundering impacts of 
the cubes striking each other.  

These bolts carry a portion of Acheron's heart within them. When these bolts strike an opponent, 
they do so with so much force that the impact has the potential to stun an opponent and leave him 
helpless for a period of time.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
– Target must save vs. Death or be stunned for one round

THAC0: +1
Damage: 1d4+1 (crushing)
Launcher: Crossbow

Weight: 0

3.2. Acidic Sponge Bolts +1 (available: SoD chapter 8 or later)
The putty-like globes on the heads of these crossbow bolts are actually dried-up aquatic sponges 
found in many of the great lakes of Bytopia. Seemingly unremarkable to most scholars, these tiny 
sponges were accidentally discovered to have the property of being able to absorb acids and store 
them in their bodies with no harm to themselves. 

As a result, great masses of these creatures were gathered and bred for use as weapons against 
fiends in the Blood War. After being fed a steady diet of acid for a few days, the sponges are 
harvested, dried, and covered with a resin that keeps a soft bubble around the sponge. The sponge 
is then mounted on the head of an arrow or crossbow bolt and is ready for use. 

When the tip of the bolt strikes a creature with sufficient force, the resin bubble bursts, the 
sponge flattens, and the target is doused with acid. 

STATISTICS:

THAC0: +1
Damage: 1d2+1, +6 acid damage (Save vs. Breath for half)
Damage type: Missile
Launcher: Crossbow

Weight: 0

3.3. "Rule of Threes" Bolts (available: SoD chapter 10 or later)
These crossbow bolts are the work of a twisted mechanical genius. Just beneath the head of each 
bolt is a small catch, that when pressed, unlocks the head of the bolt, allowing it to divide. 
From what you can tell, once the bolts are unlocked, the pyramid-shaped heads are carefully 
fashioned so that each one splits into three on impact. Each triangle-shaped fragment then tears a 
different route through the target's body, wreaking havoc on his internal organs. 

STATISTICS:

Damage: 1d10+5 (missile)
Launcher: Crossbow

Weight: 0

3.4. Zephyr Bolts +1 (available: BG1 chapter 1 or later)
These crossbow bolts have heads with grooves cut into the sides. They do no more damage than normal 
crossbow bolts, but they bear a minor enchantment that allows them to correct their path in flight, 
making them more likely to hit an opponent. 

STATISTICS:

THAC0: +1
Damage: 1d8 (missile)
Launcher: Crossbow

Weight: 0

3.5. Bolts of Whistling Doom +2 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 6 or later)
These bolts have somehow captured the deadly harmonic of Pandemonium and then added insult to 
injury by imprisoning an enraged air elemental inside the head of the bolt. When one of these bolts 
strike an opponent, the head shatters, and the air elemental is released. The elemental will whip 
around the opponent in a frenzy, making one strike before it vanishes. 

STATISTICS:

THAC0: +2
Damage: 4d4 (crushing)
Launcher: Crossbow

3.6. Bolts of Wincing +1 (available: SoD chapter 10 or later)
These crotch-shaped bolts have been enchanted with one thing in mind: emasculation. When fired, 
they home in on the most vulnerable point on a victim's body, sink into the flesh, then the head of 
each bolt scissors outwards, making it nearly impossible to pull out and increasing the damage 
considerably. The name of the bolts comes from the reactions of spectators after the bolts are fired.

STATISTICS:

THAC0: +1
Damage: 1d8+1, +4 slashing damage

3.7. Winged Bolts (available: BG1 chapter 1 or later)
The heads of these bolts have been carved to resemble a pair of feathered wings. The bolts are 
extremely light and look more like arrows than crossbow bolts. Although not magical, they are more 
accurate and do more damage when they strike an opponent than standard crossbow bolts.

STATISTICS:

3.8. Jagged Bolts +1 (available: BG1 chapter 5 or later)
These enchanted bolts have a series of jagged black runes traced along the shaft. When fired, the 
runes rise upwards like spines, forming an additional row of vicious edges that tear into a target. 

STATISTICS:

THAC0: +1
Damage: 1d4+2 (missile)
Launcher: Crossbow

Weight: 0

3.9. Bolts of Kessek the Devourer +2 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 3 or later)
Also called "Kessek's Teeth," the head of these enchanted bolts are made of bone and have two long 
fangs curving out from the center. When one of these bolts strikes an opponent, the fangs takes on 
a life of their own and begin eating their way slowly and painfully through the victim's body. 

According to legend, Kessek was a bariaur chieftain on the Outlands who was forced to watch his 
people starve during a winter storm in the Cleft of Tears many centuries ago. Trapped in the Cleft 
because of heavy snows, he sent scouts from his tribe out to seek aid from his neighbors, the 
province of Ohinru. 

Learning of the bariaurs' plight, the merchant princes of Ohinru saw an opportunity to wipe out the 
"nomadic pests" and claim their lands for their own. The bariaur scouts were executed and their 
heads mounted on the walls so that, "the vultures might feed while the bariaurs starved." 

When the storms cleared and more than half of his tribe had died of starvation, Kessek finally 
learned what had happened to his scouts. Consumed with an insane fire, he fashioned a sheaf of 
bolts from the teeth and bones of his people who had starved to death. Once he had finished, 
he traveled to Ohinru in the night and fired his bolts blindly in the city streets, the name of 
each bariaur that had died whispered on his lips as he released each shaft. 

Each bolt he fired twisted in flight, hungrily searching for a victim and each found one… then 
another, then another. The night was filled with the choked screams of the citizens of Ohinru as 
the devourers claimed their bodies. 

When dawn touched the city, the vultures fed again. No trace of Kessek could be found.

The bolts of Kessek the Devourer can still be found scattered across the planes. It is said that 
for each victim the bolts claim, that another bolt is born… with the same hunger as the first.

4. War Hammers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4.1. Brimstone Hammer +1 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 2 or later)
This type of weapon, thought to be forged by the flames of the Elemental Plane of Fire, is 
extremely rare, even in Sigil. The elemental properties of the hammer grants its wielder an 
increased resistance to fire and fire-based attacks. In addition, when used in combat, the hammer 
deals out additional damage when it successfully connects, searing its target with crackling flames.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:

4.2. Foolsmiter +2 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 2 or later)
This war hammer has a huge stone head in the shape of a rectangular block. Faint traces of gore and 
blood are on all sides of the hammer's head. The shaft is of a thick wood that looks too weak to 
support the hammer head's weight.

This enchanted hammer was used as a tool by the Athar at one time during their religious 
persecution phase of their faction history. The magical war-hammer "Foolsmiter" was constructed so 
that it did additional damage against opponents who were particularly stupid. When it was crafted, 
however, the enchantment was twisted such that if the user was less intelligent than the target 
struck by the hammer, the wielder would take damage as well. For many years, the hammer became a 
test rite between rival members of the Athar as a primitive (and lethal) IQ test. It was stolen 
from their headquarters in the Shattered Temple many years ago and has resurfaced once or twice 
across the planes.

It is believed that the Intelligence vs. Intelligence contest the hammer once inflicted on the 
wielder and his enemies has dissipated from the hammer over time, but no one has been confident 
enough to put it to the test.

STATISTICS:

4.3. Hammer of Quality (available: BG1 chapter 1 or later)

4.5. Hammer of Comminution +2 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 6 or later)
Research reveals that this is a formidable weapon indeed. Far superior to a normal hammer, this war 
hammer (also called "The Hammer of Comminution") delivers a devastating strike that not only 
inflicts crushing damage, but also fractures any surface it contacts, whether bone, metal, or wood, 
inflicting extra damage… and if the victim survives, it also "softens" him up for the next attack. 

The Hammer of Comminution was used extensively by Enote, a Doomguard priest, in 14 E.U. 
A philosopher who was prone to violent mood swings while debating theology, he was known to espouse 
the virtues of the hammer as a means of furthering the decay of dead matter. Whether or not what he 
struck with the hammer was dead or alive before the blow is open to debate.

5.2. Devil's Due +2 (available: SoD chapter 10 or later)
This weapon has a black metal handle that seems to have grown into the narrow skull that is affixed 
to its top. The metal looks as if it has grown out from the skull, and spikes pierce through the 
eye sockets, jaw, and from the skull cap itself.  

The "metal" is not metal at all, but the remnants of a creature's forearm that punched through the 
base of the fiendish skull that now bedecks the head of this weapon. The spikes that have pierced 
through the skull actually appear to be some sort of quills from the creature's forearm.

When this weapon is used in combat and the spikes of the club penetrate a creature's skin, acid
oozes from the quills either into the target or the wielder, doing additional damage.

The common name of this weapon is "Devil's Due." To who or what event it refers to is unknown, but 
it was obviously a painful experience for the two parties involved.

STATISTICS:

5.3. Fiend Femur +2 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 6 or later)
This tanar'ri femur carries the last traces of a balor's essence within its marrow. Disgraced in 
battle and torn apart by its fellow fiends in a ceremonial execution, the bone has since carried 
with it a vengeful spite towards all of its kind. 

When the femur strikes any tanar'ri or baatezu, serrated teeth bristle up and down the length of 
the bone and cause tremendous damage to any tanar'ri or baatezu.

5.4. Club of Nettles (available: BG1 chapter 5 or later)
This club seems to be made from some sort of prickly plant. Small thorns adorn the head of the club 
and can easily be broken off.

This particular club is one of the more favored weapons of thieves. Upon making a successful hit on 
an opponent, tiny barbed thorns lodge into the skin and cause the victim to become disoriented for 
a brief period of time. This allows the thief time to safely rob and escape the victim.

~~~~~~~~

6.1. Blind Terror +2 (available: SoD chapter 8 or later)
When an opponent is struck with sufficient force, acid is released thru the spongy surface of the 
mace. From the resulting spray of acid, the adversary can become temporarily blinded making him 
easier to hit.

6.2. Baatezu Mace +1 (available: BG1 chapter 5 or later)
Made from ore found only in the wastelands of Avernus. Baatezu have created a metal called 
Baatorian green steel. Weapons produced from this metal are lighter and stronger than those forged 
of ordinary steel and tend to inflict greater damage. Although produced in great quantities for 
the Blood Wars, weapons such as these are rarely found outside of Baator.

6.4. The Justifier +2 (available: SoD chapter 10 or later)
This mace looks much like any other mace - a spiked ball atop a wooden shaft, leather handgrip with 
a thong to prevent losing it in the heat of battle. Where it differs is in the Eye etched in acid 
on the head of the weapon, a stylized sigil of the god Horus.

This weapon is The Justifier, a mace created in the city of Heliopolis on the plane of Arcadia, 
designed to aid the followers of law and good. It can heal its owner, if asked, and harbors a 
special hatred for the forces of chaos and evil.

7. Morning Stars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

7.1. Heaven and Earth +4 (available: BG2:ToB chapter 9 or later)
A fearsome aura of power emanates from this massive weapon. Sharp, powerful lines adorn the shaft 
of this mace, which streak directly to a perfect sphere that serves as this weapon's contact point. 
Perfectly curved spikes emanate from the perfectly-shaped sphere, yielding an image that is at once 
both arresting, yet awe-inspiring. A vibrant, royal purple hue surrounds this weapon of power.

Upon holding the weapon it is instantly apparent that only those that are pure of heart can truly 
wield it.

8. Long Sword
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

8.1. Celestial Fire +3 (available: BG2:ToB chapter 8 or later)
"Celestial Fire" is the only object that Trias had left to remind him of the Upper Planes. It is 
warm to the touch, and flames have been carved across the surface of the head. The intricacy of the 
carvings is breathtaking; they are done with such skill that the sword seems to be burning with 
metallic flames… someone must have spent several centuries rendering them. The metal of the sword 
is unfamiliar… it is heavy, but it shines like silver.

The sword looks several millennia old. A faint hum can be felt within it, and the vibration becomes 
stronger when it touches human flesh. Not surprisingly, "Celestial Fire" can be wielded only by 
those with sufficient strength and purity of heart. When used in combat, "Celestial Fire" bursts 
into a holy radiance that burns any evil creature it strikes in combat.

8.2. Dûrgaläd +3 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 6 or later)
This magnificient weapon was forged by the svartalves of Svartalfheim in Nidavellir, the third 
layer of Ysgard. It was made from mithral, and ancient Drow magic imbued it with the radiance of 
the caves of Svartalfheim. The sword was originally given to Garadun of Sigil for his bravery when 
he aided the svartalves in their battle against giant fiendish bats.

The weapon allows the wielder to see the true nature of all things by dispelling any illusions and 
deceptions that would otherwise mislead the unwary.

– Dispels illusionary protections, including projected images, when the sword strikes an opponent

9. Bastard Sword
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

9.1. Abigail +1 (available: BG1 chapter 5 or later)
This blade has been created for a single purpose: to eradicate oozes, slimes and jellies of all 
kind. The razor sharp blade is made from alchemically-strengthened black obsidian which is harder 
than steel and immune to the corrosive effects of oozes and related monsters.

Not much is known about the origins of the blade. There are no tales recorded about adventurers 
slaying hordes of jellies threatening a village, nor rumors known about heroes cleaning out 
slime-infested caves single-handedly. Dispatching ooze and slime cannot match up to vanquishing 
dragons after all.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
– Oozes, slimes and jellies must save vs. Death or be utterly destroyed

9.2. Fiendblight +2 (available: SoD chapter 10 or later)
Fiendblight was originally forged by the Tanar'ri for the endless Blood War that raged across 
countless planes of existence. It was given to promising contenders for higher ranks or mercenaries 
who wanted to prove themselves in battle.

When activated the weapon forces the wielder to clutch the grip of the sword tightly, unable to 
release it without the help of divine intervention or a Remove Curse spell. The true danger of the 
weapon, however, is revealed only in actual combat. Each successful hit causes a rush of adrenaline 
so intense that the wielder goes into a frenzy with the goal to score yet another hit unless a 
successful save vs. Spell is made. To further incentivize the wielder to reach peak performance 
they are rewarded with a piece of life energy from their target on a critical hit and punished with 
self-injury on a critical miss.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– May only be removed with a Remove Curse spell

Combat abilities:
– Casts Larloch's Minor Drain on the target on a critical hit (no save)
– Applies 1d4 points of slashing damage to the wielder on a critical miss (no save)

10. Scimitars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

10.1. Thanatos +2 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 6 or later)
This scimitar was once wielded by the caliph Jassan of the Djinn in ancient times. He lost it in a 
skirmish against a horde of plundering nabassus in -6155 DR. Since then the weapon was lost and 
forgotten for millenia. Ca. 367 DR it was rediscovered by a band of experienced planewalkers on the 
banks of the river Styx on Thanatos, the 333rd layer of the Abyss, which became the new namesake of 
the weapon.

After lying in the riverbed of the Styx for so long, the weapon gradually absorbed some of its 
properties. When a target is hit by the blade it causes temporary or permanent amnesia as if 
exposed to the water of the Styx itself.

STATISTISCS:

Combat abilities:
– Each successful hit causes the target to lose 1d4 memorized spells and has a 50% chance to apply 
either Miscast Magic, Confusion or Feeblemind for three rounds to the target (save vs. Spell at -2

arcane spells of the wielder.


11. Quarterstaves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

11.1. Lifeless Companion +2 (available: BG2:SoA chapter 2 or later)
The grip of the staff looks ordinary enough. The skull attached to it, however, seems to be one of
a kind. It was once a servant in possession of Lothar, the master of the Bones of the Night.
At that time it met another skull with an unusual repertoire of insults that it continuously spew
at his fellow skull companions, and sometimes at his master as well (as long as he was out of
earshot.) Some of the insults made enough of an impression that the skull attached to the tip of
the staff repeats them when commanded, with the effect that any living creature within earshot
lowers their guard and becomes enraged.

STATISTICS:

Charge abilities:

12.1. Aegis of Torment (available: BG2:ToB chapter 9 or later)
Aegis of Torment
Rows and rows of minute skulls line the outer edge of this ring. It is crowned by an over-sized 
skull with fire-red gems that serves as its eyes. This ring is the physical manifestation of the 
suffering of the tormented slaves of Dahnthur. It was their ultimate wish to gain protection from 
their oppressors, and with this magical ring, their wish was finally realized. Even with the fiery 
red gems, a royal purple hue continually emanates outward.

12.2. Mempa's Biting Ring (available: BG2:SoA chapter 6 or later)
Mempa was a mage obsessed with the possibility of having her magic items lost or burgled while she 
was asleep or otherwise incapacitated. While the vast majority of her carried possessions were 
inseparable from her corpse and thus buried with her, some of her weaker items - early experiments, 
perhaps - were left behind and remain in the world of the living.

Mempa's Biting Ring, whose powerful aura protects its bearer from bodily harm, is one such item. 
However, once placed upon one's finger, the ring bites down and holds on so tenaciously that it is 
nigh impossible to remove it from the 'bitten' digit.

12.6. Displacer Ring (available: BG2:SoA chapter 2 or later)

than normal.

12.7. Ring of Almost Invisibility (available: SoD chapter 8 or later)
This is Yevrah's Ring of Almost Invisibility. It makes its wearer invisible - almost. Sometimes, 
for brief periods, the wearer becomes really, *really* close to being invisible - an event which 
is often disconcerting to an attacker - and is thus more difficult to strike in combat.

12.9. Ring of Thex (available: BG2:ToB chapter 9 or later)
This ornate silver ring is set with a single red stone of an unknown type. The ring is believed to 
have been created by an adventuring mage named Thex. Thex claimed she was tired of sitting back and 
flinging spells at enemies while the rest of her adventuring party was able to get into the thick 
of battle. She felt that the ring would allow her to become what she chose to call a Battlemage. 
The Ring of Thex was the crowning achievement of her short career.

From a Hero of ancient times during the Year of Gii 'on, AC195, this exquisite ring is smartly 
carved, with spiked edges. The ring is made of a metal that is unidentifiable, with a center stone 
that is ice cold to the touch. It emanates a powerful aura that protects its bearer from bodily 
harm and makes them more sensitive to the effects of the Weave - which can be a blessing or a curse.

13.2. Crimson Sphere Earrings (available: SoD chapter 8 or later)
Small red gems set into these earrings act like a heat sponge, protecting the wearer from heat or 
flame attacks. Whenever the wearer is exposed to fire, the gems draw some of the heat into 
themselves, shielding their wearer from part of the damage.

It is rumored that each of these earrings holds a tiny fire mephit inside, and that they are so 
starved for heat that they will drink deep of any fire in the vicinity. This has never been proven, 
mostly because no one really cares to investigate the matter.

STATISTICS:

13.3. Dustman Earrings (available: BG2:SoA chapter 2 or later)
These earrings have the smell of ash and dust about them and are icy cold to the touch. When worn, 
the earrings shield the wearer from temperature extremes, granting the wearer partial resistance to 
heat and cold. Furthermore, the earrings also protects the wearer from mind-influencing magics and 
magics that attack the body, including paralyzation and death magic.

The earrings signify the wearer's allegiance to the Dustman faction of Sigil. According to rumor, 
these earrings helps dull the Dustmen to the effects of the outside world.

13.4. Indep Earrings (available: BG2:SoA chapter 3 or later)
These barbed earrings mark the wearer as a member of the Indep faction from Sigil. These earrings 
are the home of an independent spirit which accompanies the wearer and does its best to protect 
them from harm. Whenever possible, the spirit gives its wearer a mental nudge to get them out of 
harm's way… the tiny counseling spirit provides the user with +1 to all Saving Throws, and its mere 
presence gives the wearer an additional bonus to avoid spells and confusion effects.

Many of these enchanted items were made in the bazaars of Sigil by a silversmith from Oerth, who 
had found a way of shaping metal in such a way that it attracted "free spirits" to the metal and 
caused them to take up residence there. The spirit is not bound to the earrings by any means; from 
what scholars have determined, there is something about the earrings that the spirits find "cozy."

13.6. Obsidian Earrings (available: BG1 chapter 5 or later)
These small earrings are made from polished obsidian. Despite the smoothness of their surface, they

Commonly referred to as "a rogue's best friends," the black gems these earrings are made from 
possess magical properties that absorb light, making it easier for their wearer to move undetected

These earrings have been made from the hardened shell of a segmented, larva-like creature. Its 
shell has been treated with some sort of glazed finish that makes it look disturbingly alive. The 
wire that hooks to the ear looks like it is part of the larva itself, perhaps its stinger or antenna.

To activate the earrings' power, the wearer must prick his thumb with the stinger, allowing it to 
bond with its new owner. When "awakened," these earrings help protect the wearer from attacks, 
giving the wearer's skin the same strength and durability of the larva's shell.

14. Bracelets and Bracers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

14.1. Bell's Shield (available: BG2:ToB chapter 9 or later)
The engravings on this bracelet are nothing short of beautiful. The craftsmanship reflects the 
skilled work of the Meh 'gahmi Sah 'ma nomadic tribes. This bracelet was carved for their greatest 
warrior-priestess, Bell, who sought to bring peace to the greater southern plains region. The 
enthralling purple stones inset along the bracelet give off a soft, warm, royal purple glow.

– Hit Points: +10
– Can memorize one extra divine spell of each level from 1st to 6th

Weight: 0

14.2. Magus Guard (available: SoD chapter 8 or later)
Considered standard equipment for any adventuring mage, bracelets such as these can be found across 
the planes. Judging by the markings on this particular bracelet it appears to have been made in a 
style quite common to Sigil. Various glyphs of warding are meticulously carved along the surface 
producing an almost hypnotic effect when looked at. When worn this bracelet protects the wearer 
from normal attacks as if they were wearing scale armor.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Armor Class: 6

Weight: 2

14.3. Magus Shield (available: BG2:SoA chapter 2 or later)
This bracelet is a variation of the Magus Guard. Essentially using the same spells and glyphs as 
its predecessor, the Magus Shield is better able to focus the energy of the enchantments placed 
upon it.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Armor Class: 4

Weight: 2

14.4. Dread Bond (available: SoD chapter 10 or later)
Legend has it that this bracelet was created by Nacek the Sadistic. Tiny razor sharp spikes cover 
the entire surface of this item injecting small amounts of rare reagents into the blood stream of 
the user. The effect of these chemicals causes the user to feel a constant adrenaline rush of 
strength.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Strength: +1
– Immunity to panic

Weight: 3

14.5. Spiked Gauntlets of Ogre Power (available: BG2:SoA chapter 6 or later)
A ridge of huge black spikes bristle along the knuckles of these metal gauntlets, allowing the 
wearer to perforate any target they punch. Clamps line the edges of the gauntlets to secure them 
in place once worn. 

These gauntlets bear an enchantment that allows the user to strike opponents with the strength of 
ten men. The spikes along the knuckles simply add insult to injury, as any victim whose bones are 
not shattered by the initial attack will slowly bleed to death from the jagged wounds the spikes 
inflict.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– THAC0: +2 when attacking with fists
– Crushing Damage: +1d4+2 when attacking with fists
– Deals additional 1d4+2 piercing damage when attacking with fists

14.6. Spider Bracelet (available: BG2:SoA chapter 2 or later)
In actuality this is a living spider not jewelry. When attached to ones wrist, the spider will sink 
its fangs into the users flesh and feed from the host, providing both beneficial and detrimental 
effects.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– +5% resistance to slashing, piercing, crushing, and missile damage
– Hit Points: +10
– Intelligence: -1
– Wisdom: -1

Weight: 0

14.7. Vambraces of Evil's Warding (available: BG1 chapter 5 or later)
These armbands, when worn, protect their wearer from the attacks of evil creatures. Their shiny 
metallic pieces of armor are graven with warding runes that attract damage to the vambraces where 
it bounces off harmlessly. Area of effect attacks there are not directly aimed at the target are 
unaffected.

It is rumored that the vambraces were created from the spirits of fallen petitioners on Arcadia, 
and their desire to combat evil still lives within the item. This theory is supported by the fact 
that when evil characters equip these vambraces, they suffer damage repeatedly for every ten rounds 
while worn.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Armor Class: +2 vs. evil creatures
– Saving Throws: +2 vs. evil creatures
– Applies 2d8 non-lethal damage to the wearer every 10 rounds when worn by evil characters
  (save vs. Death for half damage.)

Weight: 2


15. Cloaks
~~~~~~~~~~

15.1. Cowl of Deepest Shadows (available: BG2:SoA chapter 6 or later)
Just like the cowl itself the history of this artifact is shrouded in darkness. It was granted a 
member of the Doomguard faction by the goddess Shar as a reward for corrupting a group of 
worshippers of Hanali Celanil, the elven goddess of love and beauty, into self-destructive hedonism 
and despair. The cowl was lost a short time later, only to reappear occasionally for brief moments 
in the possession of less reputable individuals like assassins or agents of Shar, as if it has a 
mind of its own.

This cowl is made of an unknown material that is surprisingly light and durable. It seems to blend 
with the immediate surroundings to a degree where it becomes difficult to discern the exact shape 
of the cowl and their wearer.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Hide In Shadows: +20%
– Move Silently: +20%
– Darkvision
  THAC0: +2 bonus (outdoors at night and in dungeons)

16. Belts
~~~~~~~~~

16.1. Planar Anchor (available: BG2:SoA chapter 6 or later)
Legend has it that the aging planewalker Gojuc decided to retire in Sigil, the City of Doors, after
a successful career as adventurer, mercenary, and even an emissary on special occasions. Since the
travelling through the planes left their mark on his body he devised a spell to make him immune to
the effects of teleportation magic and tasked a local gnomish enchanter to weave it into a piece of
clothing of his choice. He was obviously pleased with the result since he lived several years
without having to contend with the numerous portals spread over the city. To his surprise he was
one day fatally injured by an errant pebble thrown by some children playing on the street. He died
from his injuries soon after. The belt and many other of his belongings were eventually sold to a
travelling merchant, and so the trail of the item was lost.

The belt is enchanted with a spell that binds the user to the current plane of existence. As a
result the user becomes immune to any effects that would involve planar travel. At the same time,
however, the strengthened link with the plane makes the user susceptible to the primary attributes
of the plane.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Immunity to Maze, Imprisonment, and teleportation effects
– Slashing Resistance: -50%
– Piercing Resistance: -50%
– Crushing Resistance: -50%
– Missile Resistance: -50%
– May only be removed with a Remove Curse spell

Weight: 2


17. Wands
~~~~~~~~~

17.1. Abyssal Pipe (available: SoD chapter 8 or later)
This is a small wooden pipe, carved to resemble the head of a demon.

When used, this pipe billows forth great gouts of deadly fumes from the planes of the Abyss.

STATISTICS:

Charge abilities:
– Cloudkill
  Damage: 1d10 poison per round
  Special: Slays creatures with 1-4 HD; creatures with 5-6 HD must save vs. Poison at -4 or die

  Duration: 1 turn

Requires:

Weight: 0

17.2. Skeletal Key (available: BG1 chapter 5 or later)
This key has been be fashioned from the finger bones of a humanoid creature. Magical symbols have 
been engraved on the surface to enchant it with a spell that opens any kinds of locks on chests, 
boxes or doors.

STATISTICS:

Charge abilities:

  Range: Visual range of the caster
  Area of Effect: Locked door or chest

18. Consumables and charged items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

18.1. Bandages (available: BG1 chapter 1 or later)
This is a roll of bandages, useful for stanching minor wounds. When applied they will heal a 
character for 3 hit points of damage.

STATISTICS:

Special: Restores 3 Hit Points.

Weight: 0

18.2. Clipped Copper Charm (available: BG1 chapter 1 or later)
This copper piece has been "clipped"… most of the copper has been shaved off, no doubt to still 
keep the appearance it is a coin and allowing the 'clipper' to use the shaved copper to make 
another coin. Although many Hive dwellers in Sigil practice this method of "making money," when 
the Fated faction practices it, they do so with a frightening sense of purpose, creating charms 
that reflect their own miserly natures.

In order to create these charms, the Fated faction seek out failed business owners and other 
individuals who once possessed great wealth, then had a reversal of fortune and were left 
destitute. These individuals are then given enchanted carving blades and asked to "clip a copper" 
for the Fated in a tedious day-long ritual, which infuses the copper coin with the last traces of 
their former luck. The ritual and the nature of the individual clipping the copper allows a minor 
enchantment to seep into the coin and affect the fortune of whoever uses it.

When the clipped copper charm is flipped into the air, it will spill into a rain of copper pieces, 
and bestow some luck upon the user.

STATISTICS:

Charge abilities:
– Minor Copper Blessing: +1 bonus to Luck
  Duration: 1 turn
  The blessing requires a donation of 11 gold pieces to work.

Weight: 0

18.3. Gordian Knot (available: BG2:ToB chapter 8 or later)
The knot binding the two ends of this rope together holds a powerful magic. When this knot is 
severed by a fighter with an edged weapon, the warrior gains a rush of confidence and arrogance, 
reducing their Wisdom but raising their Charisma. The user is also beset with the urge to gather an 
army and rush out and conquer the realms, but this urge does not rule the user's actions.

It is said that this is a knotted piece of rope that was cut in two by a conqueror on a distant 
prime material world. Every time the knot is severed, it disappears, showing up years later in the 
hands of another who can make use of its power.

STATISTICS:

Charge abilities:
– Permanent +2 bonus to Charisma
– Permanent -1 penalty to Wisdom

Weight: 0

18.4. Elixir of Horrific Separation (available: BG2:ToB chapter 9 or later)
This vial of Elixir of Horrific Separation was compounded by a scholar who'd found she possessed a 
darker half - a side of her which took control, at times, and bade her do awful things. This potion 
was to have 'split' the darker half away from her, creating two separate beings. Mercykillers from 
Sigil, however, found and executed her for a string of depraved murders before she could use it.

STATISTICS:

Horrific Separation:
When the elixir is consumed the enchantment takes hold and splits the less dominant part of the 
user into a separate being of comparable power but opposite alignment. This being can be controlled 
for five turns before it breaks free from the enchantment and either attacks the party or escapes. 
Moreover, the user's ethical part of their alignment shifts permanently towards 'neutral' (neutral 
good, true neutral or neutral evil).

The elixir will have no effect when consumed by a user whose ethical alignment is already 'neutral'.

Weight: 1

18.5. Moridor's Box (available: SoD chapter 8 or later)
This appears to be a small wooden box. Intricate designs etched in gold adorn the box. At one time 
this box would have been worthy enough to be displayed at any aristocrat's estate. However, years 
of neglect have taken their toll and it appears to be falling apart. If not for the large gem 
mounted to the front of the box, it would be worthless.

It is not known what exactly is sealed within the box. There are countless stories about it and 
none of them bode well for its owner. Some say it's an ancient dragon, while others say it's the 
evil soul of Moridor himself. Judging by the deteriorating state of the box someone must have 
already examined the seal and damaged it in the process. It is only a matter of time before the 
seal dissolves completely and releases the entity imprisoned in the box.

STATISTICS:

Special:
Opening the seal releases the imprisoned entity.

Requires:
 9 Intelligence

Weight: 2

18.6. Baku's Horn (available: SoD chapter 8 or later)
This nondescript wooden horn is in fact a magical item crafted on the Upper Planes. Similar to the 
attack of the creature for which it is named, a Baku's Horn inflicts damage upon evil creatures 
within the area of effect when it is sounded. Further, such creatures must make a save vs. 
paralyzation or flee in panic.

Charge abilities:
– Baku's Roar three times per day
  Damage: 2d8 crushing vs. evil creatures
  Special: Causes panic for one turn (Save vs. Paralysis negates)
  Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius

Weight: 1

18.7. Wesley's Hourglass (available: BG2:ToB chapter 9 or later)
This item was originally fashioned by a powerful chronomancer with the intention to teach his 
students about the nature of time. It looks like an ordinary hourglass in a wooden frame, but 
instead of sand it is filled with mist-smoke of the Demiplane of Time, also known as Temporal Prime.

When the hourglass is smashed it enables the user to step out of the normal flow of time and 
manipulate objects in a limited fashion while everything around them appears to be frozen in time. 
The mental and physical stress induced by this state causes the user to be severely fatigued after 
the effect has worn off.

STATISTICS:

Charge abilities:
– Invokes "Time Stop"
  Duration: 5 rounds
  Area of Effect: The user
  Leaves the user fatigued when the effect has worn off.

Requires:
 6 Intelligence

Weight: 1

18.8. Wesley's Improved Hourglass
Cespenar can combine Wesley's Hourglass with the Rift Device from the Eyeless Cult quest to fashion 
this improved version of the item.

18.9. The Grimoire of Pestilential Thought (available: BG2:SoA chapter 2 or later)
This black-bound tome seems to radiate a slight rotting smell, and the covers are unpleasant to the 
touch - like uncured human flesh left out in the sun. Rusted buckles on the cover seal it against 
the elements.

It is the Grimoire of Pestilential Thought, an arcane tome created ages ago for purposes unknown, 
the purpose of which is to teach mortals the nature of evil. Some sages warn against its use, while 
others urge it. It is said to grant mighty powers when services are performed for it.

STATISTICS:

Weight: 2

18.10. Tear of Salieru-Dei (available: BG2:SoA chapter 6 or later)
This glistening red tear was shed by the martyred Harmonium officer Salieru-Dei when he was put to 
death on the Harmonium's home plane of Ortho. Mistaken as a member of the hated Revolutionary 
League, Salieru-Dei's obedience and loyalty was such he could not bring himself to challenge the 
allegations of his superiors. At the moment of his execution, three tears fell from his right eye 
and turned to stone as they fell upon the flagstones of the square.

Ironically enough, an anarchist subsequently revealed the Harmonium's mistake to the public, 
discrediting them. Ever since, the tears of Salieru-Dei have been considered relics of the 
Harmonium... and used as a lesson to the evils of unquestioning obedience by the Revolutionary 
League.

STATISTICS:

Constitution: Raised by 1 point permanently

Weight: 0

18.11. Holy Ward of Amaunator (available: SoD chapter 8 or later)
This flask contains holy water blessed by Amaunator himself. It is said that the relic was so
powerful that a single drop could eradicate even powerful liches. With the decline of Amaunator's
influence in Faerûn this relic lost most of its power over time and became only a shadow of its
former self.

The relic was originally safeguarded in the ancient Netherese city of Synod, but was lost in the
tumultuous aftermath of Karsus' Folly. Many centuries later a group of adventurers discovered the
ruins of an ancient temple dedicated to Amaunator where they plundered many artifacts and relics,
including the Holy Ward.

STATISTICS:

Charge abilities:

  Special: Priests may turn targets at their class level. Paladins may turn targets with a +1 bonus
           to their current level. Everyone else may turn targets at half of their class level.

other obstacles.


20. Special items

20.1. Lim-Lim Cage (available: BG1 chapter 1 or later)
This sturdy steel cage has a thick leather handle on the top. It appears to be the home of a 
Lim-Lim which can be unmistakably identified by their gleeful chirps. The cage itself seems to be 
locked only by a simple latch.

STATISTICS:

Weight: 10

20.2. Stick with a handle? (available: BG2:ToB chapter 9 or later)

This item looks like a stick of polished metal with a handle of a shape that fits nicely in the hand.
