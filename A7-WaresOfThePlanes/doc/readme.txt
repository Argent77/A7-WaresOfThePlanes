Overview
~~~~~~~~

This mod introduces a large number of weapons and accessories from Planescape: Torment to the
Baldur's Gate series. The items can be purchased from a travelling merchant who is available
throughout the whole game.

Several items have been slightly altered to fit better into the BG series since items from the
Planescape universe are generally more powerful and unique than their Forgotten Realms counterparts.

The mod is available for BG:EE, Siege of Dragonspear, BG2:EE and EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy).


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive
into your game directory and run either "setup-A7-WaresOfThePlanes.exe" (Windows) or
"setup-A7-WaresOfThePlanes.command" (macOS). Follow the instructions and you are ready to start.

To uninstall, run "setup-A7-WaresOfThePlanes.exe" (Windows) or "setup-A7-WaresOfThePlanes.command"
(macOS) again and follow the prompts.

Note for Siege of Dragonspear (SoD):
GOG and Steam both install the "Siege of Dragonspear" expansion in a way that is not moddable 
out-of-the-box. You must first install the mod "DLC Merger" on your SoD installation before this
or any other WeiDU-based mods can be installed.
DLC Merger can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest


Installation Order & Mod Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended to install this mod after the Unfinished Business component "The Murder of Acton
Balthis" to properly handle a minor dialog conflict.
A small number of items may overlap with items from Angel's Made in Heaven - Item Pack. They won't
interfere with each other except by have the same item names though.


Components
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Wares of the Planes (for BG:EE, SoD, BG2:EE and EET)

This is the main component. It installs a large number of items from Planescape: Torment which
includes weapons, accessories, utility items, and more. They can be purchased from a unique
travelling merchant who can be found in several towns and settlements throughout the whole
Baldur's Gate series.

The travelling merchant offers a total of
- 17 Daggers
- 10 Battle Axes
- 5 War Hammers
- 5 Clubs
- 4 Maces
- 1 Morning Star
- 1 Long Sword
- 10 Rings
- 9 different types of Bolts
- 7 Earrings (can be equipped in the Amulets slot)
- 6 Bracelets (can be equipped in the Bracers/Gauntlets slot)
- 1 Wand
- several miscellaneous items
- a unique quest-related artifact
- and a pet
for sale.

As the items vary greatly in strength, they are only gradually made available as the main story
of the game progresses.


2. Identify all wares (not recommended; requires main component)

This tweak automatically identifies all wares offered by the travelling merchant.

Notes:
It is not recommended to install this tweak as it diminishes the mod experience. Install it only
if you want to complement Tweaks Anthology's subcomponent "Identify All Items" or similar tweaks.
