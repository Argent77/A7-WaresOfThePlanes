Overview
~~~~~~~~

This mod introduces a large number of weapons and accessories from the Planescape universe to the
Baldur's Gate series. The items can be purchased from a travelling merchant who is available
throughout the whole game.

Several items from Planescape: Torment have been slightly altered to fit better into the BG series
since items from the Planescape universe are generally more powerful and unique than their
Forgotten Realms counterparts.

The mod is available for BG:EE, Siege of Dragonspear, BG2:EE and EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy).


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive
into your game directory and run either "setup-A7-WaresOfThePlanes.exe" (Windows) or
"setup-A7-WaresOfThePlanes.command" (macOS). Follow the instructions and you are ready to start.

To uninstall, run "setup-A7-WaresOfThePlanes.exe" (Windows) or "setup-A7-WaresOfThePlanes.command"
(macOS) again and follow the prompts.

Note for Siege of Dragonspear (SoD):
GOG and Steam both install the "Siege of Dragonspear" expansion in a way that is not moddable 
out-of-the-box. You must first install the mod "DLC Merger" on your SoD installation before this
or any other WeiDU-based mods can be installed.
DLC Merger can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest


Installation Order & Mod Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This mod should be installed after the Unfinished Business component "The Murder of Acton Balthis"
to resolve a (mostly) cosmetic dialog conflict.

A small number of items may overlap with items from Angel's "Made in Heaven - Item Pack" and
Deratiseur's "The shooter's delight". They won't interfere with each other except by having the
same item names.

Lefreut's GUI mods (all variants) are not fully compatible with a GUI feature used by this mod.
A replacement is used instead which serves the same purpose but is not as immersive.


Components
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Wares of the Planes (for BG:EE, SoD, BG2:EE and EET)

This is the main component. It installs a large number of items from the Planescape universe which
includes weapons, accessories, utility items, and more. They can be purchased from a unique
travelling merchant who can be found in several towns and settlements throughout the whole
Baldur's Gate series.

The merchant can be found at the following locations:
- BG1: Beregost, Nashkel's Carnival or Ulgoth's Beard
- SoD: Coast Way Crossing or Coalition Camp
- BG2-SoA: Athkatla's market district, Trademeet or Imnesvale in the Umar Hills
- BG2-ToB: Saradush or Amkethran

The travelling merchant offers a total of
- 17 Daggers
- 10 Battle Axes
- 9 different types of Bolts
- 6 War Hammers
- 5 Clubs
- 4 Maces
- 1 Morning Star
- 2 Long Swords
- 2 Bastard Swords
- 2 Scimitars
- 1 Quarterstaff
- 1 Necklace
- 10 Rings
- 7 Earrings (can be equipped in the Amulets slot)
- 7 Bracelets and Bracers (can be equipped in the Bracers/Gauntlets slot)
- 1 Cloak
- 1 Belt
- 2 Wands
- 3 Spell scrolls
- several miscellaneous items
- two artifacts attached with unique quests
- and a pet
for sale.

More details about available items can be found in the file "item-descriptions.txt".

As the items vary greatly in power, they are only gradually made available as the main story of
the game progresses.


2. Identify all wares (not recommended; requires main component)

This tweak automatically identifies all wares offered by the travelling merchant.

Notes:
It is generally not recommended to install this tweak as it diminishes the mod experience.
Install it only if you want to complement Tweaks Anthology's subcomponent "Identify All Items"
or similar tweaks.


3. Alternate merchant portrait (requires main component)

This tweak installs Ebb Creakknees' original character portrait from Planescape: Torment.
