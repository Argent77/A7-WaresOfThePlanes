        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This mod introduces a large number of weapons and accessories from the Planescape universe to the Baldur's Gate series. The items can be purchased from a travelling merchant who is available throughout the whole game.</p>
        <p>Several items from Planescape: Torment have been slightly altered to fit better into the BG series since items from the Planescape universe are generally more powerful and unique than their Forgotten Realms counterparts.</p>
        <p>The mod is available for BG:EE, Siege of Dragonspear, BG2:EE and EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy).</p>

      <section id="installation">
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive into your game's installation directory (where you can find the file "chitin.key") and run <em>"setup-A7-WaresOfThePlanes.exe"</em> (Windows) or <em>"setup-A7-WaresOfThePlanes.command"</em> (macOS). Follow the instructions and you are ready to start.</p>
        <p>It is not required to start a new game after installing the mod.</p>
        <p>To uninstall, run <em>"setup-A7-WaresOfThePlanes.exe"</em> or <em>"setup-A7-WaresOfThePlanes.command"</em> again and follow the prompts.</p>
        <hr class="spacer" />
        <h3>Note for Siege of Dragonspear (SoD)</h3>
        <p>GOG and Steam both install the <em>Siege of Dragonspear</em> expansion in a way that is not moddable out of the box. You must install the mod <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation before this or any other WeiDU-based mods can be installed.</p>
        <hr class="spacer" />
        <h3>Compatibility and mod order</h3>
        <p>This mod should be installed after the Unfinished Business component "The Murder of Acton Balthis" to resolve a (mostly) cosmetic dialog conflict.</p>
        <p>A small number of items may overlap with items from Angel's "Made in Heaven - Item Pack" and Deratiseur's "The shooter's delight". They won't interfere with each other except by having the same item names.</p>
        <p>Lefreut's GUI mods (all variants) are not fully compatible with a GUI feature used by this mod. A replacement is used instead which serves the same purpose but is not as immersive.</p>

            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> It is generally not recommended to install this tweak as it diminishes the mod experience. Install it only if you want to complement Tweaks Anthology's subcomponent "Identify All Items" or similar tweaks.</p>

This feather is ash-gray, fading to black around the edges. It is much larger than a bird feather, and it creates an unpleasant tingling sensation when held for more than a minute.<br/>
<br/>
Examination of the feather reveals that is the feather from a Vrock, one of the many races of tanar'ri that fill the Abyss. The Vrock resemble huge vultures, and they are often used as scouts for the tanar'ri forces in the Blood War.<br/>
<br/>
This particular feather is believed to have been taken from a Vrock shaman, who is reported to have died by simply disbelieving himself. Possessed of a certain mental imbalance and with an odious habit of devouring his followers to gain strength, this crazy Vrock was rumored to be capable of causing others of his flock to behave erratically - much more so than for a normal tanar'ri. He convinced many of his flock to tear off their wings and take up burrowing in the ground. Other times, he preached the virtues of honesty as being more evil and destructive than any lie. When he disintegrated, only the feather was left behind as testament to his fevered existence. Some of the shaman's residue is believed to reside in this "Chaos Feather."<br/>
<br/>
The Chaos Feather, when used in combat as a dagger, inflicts a minor amount of damage (about the same as a conventional dagger) and has the power to confuse any target it strikes. Creatures struck by the feather may be stunned, run away, or attack their allies.<br/>
<br/>
Most tanar'ri consider the feather to be a sacred object. Vrocks will kill anyone possessing it in order to retrieve it.<br/>

This is a silver dining fork. Its tines are especially sharp. Upon further consideration, it might be able to be used as a dagger, though it most likely wouldn't do any more damage than a conventional dagger.

This slim dagger has been forged out of the famed Baatorian green steel. Found only in the wastelands of Avernus, this peculiar green ore can be tempered into metal much lighter than normal steel. In addition, green steel weapons tend to retain their remarkably fine edges and are capable of dealing out more damage than their standard counterparts.<br/>

The final achievement of one Kaarlac Cragenmoor, this enchanted knife is a boon to those who practice the mystic arts. Kaarlac, ever one to aspire to greatness, sought to create a magic item that could retain an imprint of a portion of his memory - particularly the short term memory that contained his considerable spell repertoire. He theorized that, if successful, he could effectively double the amount of spell knowledge he could retain at any given time.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the enchantment was beyond his capability and in the midst of his fervent casting, Kaarlac went mad and plunged the knife into his own chest. His sacrifice, however, was not completely in vain, for the knife possesses enough of the intended enchantment to bestow upon its wielder the ability to memorize several additional first level spells.<br/>

This small dagger looks fragile, but a series of jagged teeth line the edge of the blade. The hilt itself is covered with dried blood, most likely the blood of the users who held the weapon and were unable to release their grip.<br/>
<br/>
Research indicates that this cursed dagger has had many names, the most prominent of which was "Last Resort." When equipped, the user cannot release the grip until death, or until the curse is lifted by spell or divine intervention. Although the dagger is slower than most two-handed weapons and the damage it inflicts is comparable to a scratch, it is rumored to be able to hurt almost any creature it strikes, no matter what the creature's plane of origin or its defenses. One adventurer who had freed herself from its curse actually chose to travel with it, figuring that in any instance where she *had* to use it couldn't be worsened by having it in her possession.<br/>

This magnificent axe, known as "Blindsider," is truly one of a kind. It is rumored that it was the creation of one Akyzum Yar, chief metallurgist of an ancient empire on the Prime Material Plane. The Emperor whom Yar served, a vain and wicked man, commissioned the creation of "a weapon of unsurpassed beauty." After years of toiling, Yar succeeded and presented the Emperor with "Blindsider," whereupon he was promptly put to death so that his work could never be reproduced.<br/>
<br/>
The various ores and enchantments employed in the forging of this weapon yielded a new type of metal that is lightweight, durable, and highly reflective. The axe earned its name from its tendency to reflect light into the eyes of its opponent, temporarily blinding the target so that its wielder can easily cut him down. Additionally, its wielder is granted immunity to blinding attacks as a magical byproduct of its reflective nature.<br/>

This giant, axe-like cleaver earned its nickname while in the hands of Oswell Breck, a butcher who once serviced the Clerk's Ward of Sigil. The rumor goes that one day this affable and well-respected citizen suddenly went on a murderous and bloody rampage that lasted ten days and ten nights. Cleaver in hand, Oswell stalked the streets of the ward, brutally hacking down every man, woman, and child unlucky enough to cross his path until the Lady of Pain herself intervened. It is rumored that he suffered from a strange disease that slowly caused his body to waste away, and it was this disease that eroded his sanity and prompted the murder spree.<br/>
<br/>
The origin of this instrument of carnage is shrouded in mystery. However, the various wizards and scholars who examined the discarded weapon after Oswell's mazing have catalogued the nature of its enchantment. The cleaver seems to feed upon its victims, sucking the very life force from them and bestowing a portion of it upon its wielder.<br/>

A single teardrop of the wielder's blood, applied at the border where the axe meets the handle, is sufficient to awaken "Heartgrinder." Once applied, the drop of blood freckles across the blade and handle, giving it a dull red radiance. The glow from Heartgrinder pulses, matching the heartbeat of its wielder.<br/>
<br/>
No matter what the target, Heartgrinder is a powerful weapon, capable of tearing through nearly any defenses. Against targets with blood running in their veins (whether their own or another's - vampires beware), Heartgrinder inflicts additional damage, as every stroke also smashes the target's heart, no matter what location the axe struck.<br/>

This archaic double-bladed battle-axe is reminiscent of an executioner's axe; the axe head has been forged into the symbol of the Mercykiller Faction (a red dragon with its wings outspread… the outstretched wings have been shaped into the blades of the axe.) The axe itself is huge; it would require tremendous strength to use effectively.<br/>
<br/>
This axe carries part of Vhailor's essence within it. As a result, it is utterly devoted to justice and will not allow the user to rest while "judgments" are left to be delivered. The considerable damage it causes to an opponent is doubled if the axe strikes a guilty or chaotic creature. Furthermore, the axe itself lends some of its strength to the wielder, giving them added protection from attacks.<br/>
<br/>
The origin of this axe is unknown. If you were to hazard a guess, the axe gained its powers simply from Vhailor's belief.<br/>

When its powers are awakened and its name known, "Edge of Oblivion" becomes entirely black… where once just the edges were ebony, now the blackness has spread across the entire blade. The chill the blade radiates has increased ten-fold, so much so that it is painful to hold it for too long.<br/>
<br/>
"Edge of Oblivion" does disintegration damage every time it strikes an opponent… for every wound it causes, it also disintegrates the flesh around the target area, simultaneously cauterizing the wound as it strikes.<br/>
<br/>
There is some speculation that a Sphere of Annihilation has somehow been encaged within the axe itself, but again this is only speculation. Given that the planes are infinite, anything is possible.<br/>

These enchanted bolts have been fashioned from one of the great cubes of Acheron. According to many planar scholars, Acheron is a plane in perpetual war with itself, where huge cubes the size of continents float through the ether and smash against each other. On the surface of these cubes, legions of soldiers wage war on each other, swarming from cube to cube and attacking whoever else they can find. The plane is filled with the ringing of steel and the great thundering impacts of the cubes striking each other.<br/>
<br/>
These bolts carry a portion of Acheron's heart within them. When these bolts strike an opponent, they do so with so much force that the impact has the potential to stun an opponent and leave him helpless for a period of time.<br/>

The putty-like globes on the heads of these crossbow bolts are actually dried-up aquatic sponges found in many of the great lakes of Bytopia. Seemingly unremarkable to most scholars, these tiny sponges were accidentally discovered to have the property of being able to absorb acids and store them in their bodies with no harm to themselves.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, great masses of these creatures were gathered and bred for use as weapons against fiends in the Blood War. After being fed a steady diet of acid for a few days, the sponges are harvested, dried, and covered with a resin that keeps a soft bubble around the sponge. The sponge is then mounted on the head of an arrow or crossbow bolt and is ready for use.<br/>
<br/>
When the tip of the bolt strikes a creature with sufficient force, the resin bubble bursts, the sponge flattens, and the target is doused with acid.<br/>

These crossbow bolts are the work of a twisted mechanical genius. Just beneath the head of each bolt is a small catch, that when pressed, unlocks the head of the bolt, allowing it to divide. From what you can tell, once the bolts are unlocked, the pyramid-shaped heads are carefully fashioned so that each one splits into three on impact. Each triangle-shaped fragment then tears a different route through the target's body, wreaking havoc on his internal organs.<br/>

These crotch-shaped bolts have been enchanted with one thing in mind: emasculation. When fired, they home in on the most vulnerable point on a victim's body, sink into the flesh, then the head of each bolt scissors outwards, making it nearly impossible to pull out and increasing the damage considerably. The name of the bolts comes from the reactions of spectators after the bolts are fired.<br/>

Also called "Kessek's Teeth," the head of these enchanted bolts are made of bone and have two long fangs curving out from the center. When one of these bolts strikes an opponent, the fangs takes on a life of their own and begin eating their way slowly and painfully through the victim's body.<br/>
<br/>
According to legend, Kessek was a bariaur chieftain on the Outlands who was forced to watch his people starve during a winter storm in the Cleft of Tears many centuries ago. Trapped in the Cleft because of heavy snows, he sent scouts from his tribe out to seek aid from his neighbors, the province of Ohinru.<br/>
<br/>
Learning of the bariaurs' plight, the merchant princes of Ohinru saw an opportunity to wipe out the "nomadic pests" and claim their lands for their own. The bariaur scouts were executed and their heads mounted on the walls so that, "the vultures might feed while the bariaurs starved."<br/>
<br/>
When the storms cleared and more than half of his tribe had died of starvation, Kessek finally learned what had happened to his scouts. Consumed with an insane fire, he fashioned a sheaf of bolts from the teeth and bones of his people who had starved to death. Once he had finished, he traveled to Ohinru in the night and fired his bolts blindly in the city streets, the name of each bariaur that had died whispered on his lips as he released each shaft.<br/>
<br/>
Each bolt he fired twisted in flight, hungrily searching for a victim and each found one… then another, then another. The night was filled with the choked screams of the citizens of Ohinru as the devourers claimed their bodies.<br/>
<br/>
When dawn touched the city, the vultures fed again. No trace of Kessek could be found.<br/>
<br/>
The bolts of Kessek the Devourer can still be found scattered across the planes. It is said that for each victim the bolts claim, that another bolt is born… with the same hunger as the first.<br/>

This war hammer has a huge stone head in the shape of a rectangular block. Faint traces of gore and blood are on all sides of the hammer's head. The shaft is of a thick wood that looks too weak to support the hammer head's weight.<br/>

This enchanted hammer was used as a tool by the Athar at one time during their religious persecution phase of their faction history. The magical war-hammer "Foolsmiter" was constructed so that it did additional damage against opponents who were particularly stupid. When it was crafted, however, the enchantment was twisted such that if the user was less intelligent than the target struck by the hammer, the wielder would take damage as well. For many years, the hammer became a test rite between rival members of the Athar as a primitive (and lethal) IQ test. It was stolen from their headquarters in the Shattered Temple many years ago and has resurfaced once or twice across the planes.<br/>
<br/>
It is believed that the Intelligence vs. Intelligence contest the hammer once inflicted on the wielder and his enemies has dissipated from the hammer over time, but no one has been confident enough to put it to the test.<br/>

Research reveals that this is a formidable weapon indeed. Far superior to a normal hammer, this war hammer (also called "The Hammer of Comminution") delivers a devastating strike that not only inflicts crushing damage, but also fractures any surface it contacts, whether bone, metal, or wood, inflicting extra damage… and if the victim survives, it also "softens" him up for the next attack.<br/>
<br/>
The Hammer of Comminution was used extensively by Enote, a Doomguard priest, in 14 E.U. A philosopher who was prone to violent mood swings while debating theology, he was known to espouse the virtues of the hammer as a means of furthering the decay of dead matter. Whether or not what he struck with the hammer was dead or alive before the blow is open to debate.<br/>

Forged in the depths of the Dwarvish Mountains of the Outlands, Soul Mirror is a war hammer that was revered as both a relic and a test within the clan that forged it. The dwarves of this remote stronghold followed the triad of divine patrons—Dugmaren Brightmantle, Dumathoin the Keeper of Secrets Under the Mountain, and Vergadain the Laughing Dwarf—and the hammer embodies aspects of all three.<br/>
<br/>
The weapon is forged from star-iron which resonates faintly with planar neutrality inherent to the Outlands, with a single crystal inlaid in a niche on one side of the hammerhead. Like many things wrought in the Outlands, the hammer is suffused with the plane's tendency towards balance and neutrality. It does not reward fury, strength, or raw will to dominate, but instead amplifies the wielder's clarity of thought, intuition and mental discipline. A dwarf who wields the hammer is said to "carry the weight of their own thoughts into battle", making it as much a religious tool as a martial one.<br/>
<br/>
The artifact was lost during a raid on a neighboring elven settlement. It eventually wound up in the possession of a member of Sigil's faction of the Believers of the Source where it continued to be used as a test of faith and clarity for new faction members.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike regular weapons Soul Mirror draws its power from the wielder's mental strength, which makes it a deadly tool for a wise sage but reduces it to nothing more than a toy for savage barbarians. Although originally forged by and for dwarves, this weapon can be wielded by members of any race without apparent restrictions. However, given the craftmanship of dwarven weaponsmiths, one can never be certain.<br/>

This weapon has a black metal handle that seems to have grown into the narrow skull that is affixed to its top. The metal looks as if it has grown out from the skull, and spikes pierce through the eye sockets, jaw, and from the skull cap itself.<br/>
<br/>
The "metal" is not metal at all, but the remnants of a creature's forearm that punched through the base of the fiendish skull that now bedecks the head of this weapon. The spikes that have pierced through the skull actually appear to be some sort of quills from the creature's forearm.<br/>
<br/>
When this weapon is used in combat and the spikes of the club penetrate a creature's skin, acid oozes from the quills either into the target or the wielder, doing additional damage.<br/>
<br/>
The common name of this weapon is "Devil's Due." To who or what event it refers to is unknown, but it was obviously a painful experience for the two parties involved.<br/>

"Celestial Fire" is the only object that the angelic deva Trias had left to remind him of the Upper Planes. It is warm to the touch, and flames have been carved across the surface of the head. The intricacy of the carvings is breathtaking; they are done with such skill that the sword seems to be burning with metallic flames… someone must have spent several centuries rendering them. The metal of the sword is unfamiliar… it is heavy, but it shines like silver.<br/>
<br/>
The sword looks several millennia old. A faint hum can be felt within it, and the vibration becomes stronger when it touches human flesh. Not surprisingly, "Celestial Fire" can be wielded only by those with sufficient strength and purity of heart. When used in combat, "Celestial Fire" bursts into a holy radiance that burns any evil creature it strikes in combat.<br/>

This magnificient weapon was forged by the svartalves of Svartalfheim in Nidavellir, the third layer of Ysgard. It was made from mithral, and ancient Drow magic imbued it with the radiance of the caves of Svartalfheim. The sword was originally given to Garadun of Sigil for his bravery when he aided the svartalves in their battle against giant fiendish bats.<br/>

The weapon allows the wielder to see the true nature of all things by dispelling any illusions and deceptions that would otherwise mislead the unwary.<br/>

This blade has been created for a single purpose: to eradicate oozes, slimes and jellies of all kind. The razor sharp blade is made from alchemically-strengthened black obsidian which is harder than steel and immune to the corrosive effects of oozes and related monsters.<br/>

Not much is known about the origins of the blade.

When activated the weapon forces the wielder to clutch the grip of the sword tightly, unable to release it without the help of divine intervention or a Remove Curse spell. The true danger of the weapon, however, is revealed only in actual combat. Each successful hit causes a rush of adrenaline so intense that the wielder goes into a frenzy with the goal to score yet another hit unless a successful save vs. Spell is made. To further incentivize the wielder to reach peak performance they are rewarded with a piece of life energy from their target on a critical hit and punished with self-injury on a critical miss.<br/>

This scimitar was once wielded by the caliph Jassan of the Djinn in ancient times. He lost it in a skirmish against a horde of plundering nabassus in -6155 DR. Since then the weapon was lost and forgotten for millennia. Ca. 367 DR it was rediscovered by a band of experienced planewalkers on the banks of the river Styx on Thanatos, the 333rd layer of the Abyss, which became the new namesake of the weapon.<br/>
<br/>
After lying in the riverbed of the Styx for so long, the weapon gradually absorbed some of its properties. When a target is hit by the blade it causes temporary or permanent amnesia as if exposed to the water of the Styx itself.<br/>

The grip of the staff looks ordinary enough. The skull attached to it, however, seems to be one of a kind. It was once a servant in possession of Lothar, the master of the Bones of the Night. At that time it met another skull with an unusual repertoire of insults that it continuously spew at his fellow skull companions, and sometimes at his master as well (as long as he was out of earshot.) Some of the insults made enough of an impression that the skull attached to the tip of the staff repeats them when commanded, with the effect that any living creature within earshot lowers their guard and falls into a rage.<br/>

Necklaces like these were crafted by the nomadic Rengarth tribes over 1700 years ago. They were primarily used by the shamans of the tribes in ceremonies and occasionally as support in their skirmishes with rival tribes and the ever-present threat posed by the Netheril Empire.<br/>
<br/>
These necklaces consist of bones, teeth and claws from wolves, bears, boars, and several other animals, held together by strong but flexible leather thongs. They provide a number of superficial magic abilities. But the more powerful enchantments are mysterious and resist even powerful divination attempts.<br/>
<br/>
This particular necklace wound up in the possession of a Netherese noble of Thultanthar before the city was lost for centuries when it shifted into the Plane of Shadow. About 1279 DR a member of the Doomguard faction returned with it from a planar excursion and sold it to a band of adventurers in Sigil where the trail of the item was lost again until it showed up recently in possesion of Ebb Creakknees' store.<br/>
<br/>
Despite its crude appearance the necklace is surprisingly well made and seems to be enchanted to withstand the test of time. Every bone and claw fits seamlessly into each other, making it very sturdy but comfortably to wear at the same time. However, given its barbaric appearance, people in more civilized regions might feel repulsed if the necklace is worn openly.<br/>

Mempa was a mage obsessed with the possibility of having her magic items lost or burgled while she was asleep or otherwise incapacitated. While the vast majority of her carried possessions were inseparable from her corpse and thus buried with her, some of her weaker items - early experiments, perhaps - were left behind and remain in the world of the living.<br/>

Mempa's Biting Ring, whose powerful aura protects its bearer from bodily harm, is one such item. However, once placed upon one's finger, the ring bites down and holds on so tenaciously that it is nigh impossible to remove it from the 'bitten' digit.<br/>

This ornate silver ring is set with a single red stone of an unknown type. The ring is believed to have been created by an adventuring mage named Thex. Thex claimed she was tired of sitting back and flinging spells at enemies while the rest of her adventuring party was able to get into the thick of battle. She felt that the ring would allow her to become what she chose to call a Battlemage. The Ring of Thex was the crowning achievement of her short career.<br/>

These barbed earrings mark the wearer as a member of the Indep faction from Sigil. These earrings are the home of an independent spirit which accompanies the wearer and does its best to protect them from harm.

<br/>
Many of these enchanted items were made in the bazaars of Sigil by a silversmith from Oerth, who had found a way of shaping metal in such a way that it attracted "free spirits" to the metal and caused them to take up residence there. The spirit is not bound to the earrings by any means; from what scholars have determined, there is something about the earrings that the spirits find "cozy."<br/>

These earrings have been made from the hardened shell of a segmented, larva-like creature. Its shell has been treated with some sort of glazed finish that makes it look disturbingly alive. The wire that hooks to the ear looks like it is part of the larva itself, perhaps its stinger or antenna.<br/>

To activate the earrings' power, the wearer must prick his thumb with the stinger, allowing it to bond with its new owner. When "awakened," these earrings help protect the wearer from attacks, giving the wearer's skin the same strength and durability of the larva's shell.<br/>

Just like the cowl itself the history of this artifact is shrouded in darkness. It was granted a member of the Doomguard faction by the goddess Shar as a reward for corrupting a group of worshippers of Hanali Celanil, the elven goddess of love and beauty, into self-destructive hedonism and despair. The cowl was lost a short time later, only to reappear occasionally for brief moments in the possession of less reputable individuals like assassins or agents of Shar, as if it has a mind of its own.<br/>

Legend has it that the aging planewalker Gojuc decided to retire in Sigil, the City of Doors, after a successful career as adventurer, mercenary, and even an emissary on special occasions. Since the travelling through the planes left their mark on his body he devised a spell to make him immune to the effects of teleportation magic and tasked a local gnomish enchanter to weave it into a piece of clothing of his choice. He was obviously pleased with the result since he lived several years without having to contend with the numerous portals spread over the city. To his surprise he was one day fatally injured by an errant pebble thrown by some children playing on the street. He died from his injuries soon after. The belt and many other of his belongings were eventually sold to a travelling merchant, and so the trail of the item was lost.<br/>
<br/>
The belt is enchanted with a spell that binds the user to the current plane of existence. As a result the user becomes immune to any effects that would involve planar travel. At the same time, however, the strengthened link with the plane makes the user susceptible to the primary attributes of the plane.<br/>

This copper piece has been "clipped"… most of the copper has been shaved off, no doubt to still keep the appearance it is a coin and allowing the 'clipper' to use the shaved copper to make another coin. Although many Hive dwellers in Sigil practice this method of "making money," when the Fated faction practices it, they do so with a frightening sense of purpose, creating charms that reflect their own miserly natures.<br/>
<br/>
In order to create these charms, the Fated faction seek out failed business owners and other individuals who once possessed great wealth, then had a reversal of fortune and were left destitute. These individuals are then given enchanted carving blades and asked to "clip a copper" for the Fated in a tedious day-long ritual, which infuses the copper coin with the last traces of their former luck. The ritual and the nature of the individual clipping the copper allows a minor enchantment to seep into the coin and affect the fortune of whoever uses it.<br/>
<br/>
When the clipped copper charm is flipped into the air, it will spill into a rain of copper pieces, and bestow some luck upon the user.<br/>

Horrific Separation:<br/>
When the elixir is consumed the enchantment takes hold and splits the less dominant part of the user into a separate being of comparable power but opposite alignment. This being can be controlled for five turns before it breaks free from the enchantment and either attacks the party or escapes. Moreover, the user's ethical part of their alignment shifts permanently towards 'neutral' (neutral good, true neutral or neutral evil).<br/>
<br/>
The elixir will have no effect when consumed by a user whose ethical alignment is already 'neutral'.<br/>

Ironically enough, an anarchist subsequently revealed the Harmonium's mistake to the public, discrediting them. Ever since, the tears of Salieru-Dei have been considered relics of the Harmonium... and used as a lesson to the evils of unquestioning obedience by the Revolutionary League.<br/>

Vrock's Screech<br/>
(Evocation)<br/>
<br/>
Level: 4<br/>
Range: 0<br/>
Duration: Instant<br/>
Casting Time: 2<br/>
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius<br/>
Saving Throw: Special<br/>
<br/>
This Abyssal spell mimics the terrifying scream of a vrock. It deafens all enemies in the area of effect for one turn and stuns them for one round. Deafened spellcasters have a 50% chance to miscast any spells. Creatures of 6 hit dice or less are always affected. More powerful creatures may make a save vs. Spell to negate both effects. The area of effect is not blocked by walls or other obstacles.

This sturdy steel cage has a thick leather handle on the top. It appears to be the home of a Lim-Lim which can be unmistakably identified by their gleeful chirps. The cage itself seems to be locked only by a simple latch.<br/>
