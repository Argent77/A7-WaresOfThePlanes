@11 = ~This is the claw of a wolf. It was prepared by the nomadic Rengarth tribes in ancient times and seems to be fuelled with an aspect of the forbidden epic magic spell "Summon Behemoth."

Due to prolonged exposure to the Plane of Shadow the original enchantment was slightly corrupted. As a result, the magic does not behave entirely as intended.

A strong will is required to call forth the artifact's magic.

STATISTICS:
