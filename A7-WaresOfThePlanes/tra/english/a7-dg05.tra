@11 = ~The surface of this small dagger twists and bends as you watch, as if struggling to break free from its shape.

It looks to be made of iron, silver, and any of a number of different metals. Sometimes they blend together, other times, they submerge into the core of the blade, only to resurface again minutes later.
