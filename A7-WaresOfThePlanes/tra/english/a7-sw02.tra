@11 = ~This blade has been created for a single purpose: to eradicate oozes, slimes and jellies of all kind. The razor sharp blade is made from alchemically-strengthened black obsidian which is harder than steel and immune to the corrosive effects of oozes and related monsters.

Not much is known about the origins of the blade. There are no tales recorded about adventurers slaying hordes of jellies threatening a village, nor rumors known about heroes cleaning out slime-infested caves single-handedly. Dispatching ooze and slime cannot match up to vanquishing dragons after all.
