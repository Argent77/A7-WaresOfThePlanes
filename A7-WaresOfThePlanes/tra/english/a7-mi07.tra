@11 = ~This item was originally fashioned by a powerful chronomancer with the intention to teach his students about the nature of time. It looks like an ordinary hourglass in a wooden frame, but instead of sand it is filled with mist-smoke of the Demiplane of Time, also known as Temporal Prime.

When the hourglass is smashed it enables the user to step out of the normal flow of time and manipulate objects in a limited fashion while everything around them appears to be frozen in time.
