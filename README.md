## Overview

This mod introduces a great number of weapons and accessories from Planescape: Torment in the Baldur's Gate series. The items can be purchased from from a travelling merchant who is available throughout the whole game.

Several items have been slightly altered to fit better into the BG series since items from the Planescape universe are generally more powerful than their Forgotten Realms counterparts.

The mod is available for BG:EE, Siege of Dragonspear, BG2:EE and EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy).

## Components

### Planar Item Pack *(for BG:EE, SoD, BG2:EE and EET)*

This is the main component. It installs a great number of items from Planescape: Torment which includes weapons, accessories, utility items, and more. They can be purchased from a unique travelling merchant who can be encountered throughout the whole Baldur's Gate series.

As the items vary greatly in strength, they are only gradually made available as the main story of the game progresses.

### Identify all items *(not recommended; requires the main component)*

This tweak identifies all items introduced by the main component.

**Notes:**
It is generally not recommended to install this tweak since it diminishes the mod experience. Install it only if you want to complement Tweaks Anthology's subcomponent "Identify All Items" or similar tweaks.
